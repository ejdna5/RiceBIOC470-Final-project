# RiceBIOC470-Final-project

In order to simplify the process of testing the code, all of the files needed to run the scripts are also located in the InputData folder.

However, the scripts need to be run in the following order:
1) CombineRNAseqData.m
2) CombineMouseData.m
3) CombineAllExpressionData.m

Once these have run (1 and 2 take a little while).  The other scripts can be run in any order.
